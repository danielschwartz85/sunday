# Sunday Task Manager
A powerful and elegant task management application with a modern dark theme interface. Built with vanilla JavaScript and designed for productivity.
## </> Dev & Deploy Setup 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

That's it! No build steps or dependencies required.

## 🔀 Storage Modes

On first load, **the app prompts you to choose** a storage mode:

- **LocalStorage** — [default] tasks are stored only in your browser's `localStorage`. The sync button is disabled in this mode.
- **AirTable** — [optional] syncs tasks to an AirTable base. You will be prompted for your table name, Base ID, and API token. See [Airtable Credentials](#getting-your-airtable-credentials-for-setting-in-the-app-when-prompt). These are saved to `localStorage` so you won't be asked again.



### Setting up AirTable:

* Create a free AirTable account
* Open an AirTable "base" and create a new table
* The app expects the table to have a `data` field:

  | Property   | Value      |
  |------------|------------|
  | Field name | `data`     |
  | Field type | Long text  |
